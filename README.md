## Wiring & Connections
See the schmatics folder for the setup on which this was developed and tested. The schematic includes two linear 5v power supplies based on the LM10 Op Amp. The two power supplies are needed to power the analog and digital sides of the chip seperately. Additionally the testing was done using a ProtoCentral ADS1262 breakout board and the components on the breakout board are not shown in the schematic.
